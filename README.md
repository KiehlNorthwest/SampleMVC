# SampleMVC
Testbed for MVC framework apps

This is the sample app I use to test things for building framework apps.

Main areas  
Portal - Base MVC App upgrated to bootstrap 4  
Database - SSDT Project  
DataRetrieval - Data and Repository  
> T4 Templates for generating the code for code first  
> entities and a context with fluent API. It also builds navigation
> properties for non-lookup tables with a foreign key syntax for more 
> complicated joins    
--  
> Repository for pulling paged data, saving Excel data with returned progress  

DataTests - Data/Repository tests that use snapshots to restore the db between tests
